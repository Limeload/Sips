# Sips
A modern mobile/web app inspired by Starbucks—exclusively for vegan and lactose-intolerant coffee lovers. ☕️✨

No dairy. No confusion. Just plant-powered goodness.

**Features:**
- 100% vegan drink menu 🌿  
- Custom drink builder (choose your plant milk, flavors, and sweeteners)  
- A homepage showcasing featured vegan drinks
- Drink category browsing (coffee, tea, smoothies, etc.)
- Individual drink detail pages with ingredients and allergen information
- A "favorites" system to save preferred drinks
  
**Why this app?**  
Most coffee shop apps don’t prioritize dairy-free options or clear labeling. This app is built for people who are lactose-intolerant, vegan, or just prefer a plant-based lifestyle. 🌎💚
